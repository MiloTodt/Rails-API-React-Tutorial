Hey! This is a super-easy to follow Rails/React API tutorial that is fully in depth from start to finish. This guide shows you how to install Ruby
and Rails 5 in a Virtual Box, React JS via create-react-app and connecting the frontend and backend.


## Downloading Virtual Box

- Why Virtual Box? What is it? 
We'll be using Ubuntu to work with our rails applications so it'll be more organized for us to be working in a virtual enviorment! You can always destroy
the enviorment and reconfigure whenever you want. 

1. Download VirtualBox 5.2.22 for Mac OSX [here,](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.2.22/VirtualBox-5.2.22-126460-OSX.dmg) or Windows [here](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.2.22/VirtualBox-5.2.22-126460-Win.exe)
2. Run the installer.
3. Download Vagrant for Mac OSX [here,](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.0/vagrant_2.2.0_x86_64.dmg) or Windows [here](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.0/vagrant_2.2.0_x86_64.msi)
